LPMCBot
-------

LPMCBot is an IRC Bot designed to be easy for new programmers to get
involved in open source projects.

Recently LPMCBot was re-written by [Chance](http://github.com/ecnahc515/) using
[Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/). If you have questions please join
our IRC channel on freenode, #lpmc.

Things LPMCBot aims to be:
----
- A learning platform.
- A project with the ability to grow.
- Something fun.

Things LPMCBot doesn't aim to be:
----
- An ultra irc bot that will order you pizza.
- Something new.
- Perfect.

The goal with LPMCBot is to allow anyone to get involved with a project and
learn important new skills such as working with revision control systems such
as git, and how to contribute to a project using these tools.
